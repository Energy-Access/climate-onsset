# Climate-OnSSET  
**A climate-risk–aware extension of OnSSET for resilient electrification planning**
=================================================

Current geospatial energy access planning models do not systematically integrate climate risk metrics into spatial electrification strategies. This gap can lead to pathways that unintentionally favor areas with lower climate vulnerability, while communities already exposed to climate hazards remain underserved and lack access to resilient energy solutions. At the same time, intensifying extreme weather events present direct and escalating threats to the physical infrastructure needed to supply electricity, further jeopardizing reliable energy access for the very populations most at risk.

## 🌍 What this fork adds

Climate-OnSSET augments the standard OnSSET workflow with:


## 🔗 Relationship to OnSSET

This repository is a fork of the original OnSSET model, but it introduces a **fundamental change in planning objective**.

While standard OnSSET identifies least-cost electrification pathways based primarily on techno-economic optimization (LCOE minimization), Climate-OnSSET extends the framework to incorporate **climate vulnerability and risk exposure as planning priorities**.

In this fork, electrification strategies are not evaluated on cost alone. Instead, the model supports analysis that can prioritize settlements and technologies based on **climate risk, vulnerability, and resilience considerations**, alongside economic performance.

This represents a shift from purely cost-optimal electrification planning toward **risk-informed and resilience-oriented electrification strategies**.

Beyond adjusting techno-economic parameters, this fork introduces new approaches for **prioritizing electrification in climate-vulnerable areas**, enabling analysis that balances cost, risk, and resilience.

## Data 

OnSSET is run using Python, most easily through Jupyter Notebook, but can also be run using another Python IDE.
It is recommended to install OnSSET using Anaconda.
